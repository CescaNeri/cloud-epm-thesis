# 19th July - Thesis Defense

*Let's start with usual pleasantries, like ...*

*Good morning, my name is Francesca, and I am thrilled to present my thesis defense on the role of Oracle Cloud EPM Business Rules for Efficient Planning. 
I am deeply grateful to Prof. Matteo Francia for his guidance and support throughout this journey. 
Without further delay, let's move to the content of the project.*

## Overview

This thesis is linked to my curricular internship carried out at PwC, during which I had the opportunity to work on this project for a Holding Group which is a global leader in the fashion and design industry.

- **Introduction**: We will start with a brief overview of the project, exploring its scope, objectives and requirements.
- **EPM**: We will deepen he concept of EPM, analyzing its benefits and challenges.
- **Oracle Cloud EPM**: We will explore the Oracle Cloud EPM implementation journey with all its phases.
- **Costs and Revenues in EPM**: We will then move to the core part of the project - my role in the implementation - which regards the management of revenues and costs in the EPM environment. We will see two key processes, which are:
- **Cost allocation**
- **Intercompany management**
- **Conclusions**: Finally, we will get some insights and final thoughts about the project.

## Introduction

### Slide 1

In today's highly competitive business environment and, with the advent of **digital transformation**, companies are now offered with huge opportunities and challenges.

One of the prerequisites to stay competitive in the digital era is to be able to effectively manage **corporate performance** using performance management systems.

The goal of this project is to improve the overall financial performance of the Holding Group by improving data accuracy and gaining real-time **visibility** into financial data across all the Entities which compose the Group.

Prior to this implementation, the Holding Group faced significant **challenges** in accessing and **consolidating** financial data from across the Entities.

So, with this **EPM system**, they plan to achieve an **integrated view** of the data belonging to the different Entities, which can be used for planning, reporting, budgeting and forecasting purposes.

### Slide 2

The requirements for the project fall within the goal of designing and maintaining a **comprehensive** and **integrated** planning solution to gain visibility and control over the Group's performance. 

This implementation project is addressed to the **Management Control Department** of the Holding Group, which is responsible for assessing the financial situation and evaluating the overall performance of the Entities.

Of course, the EPM system will be used by the different **Brands**, meaning that it should be tailored to their needs.

At the same time, the system should be easy to use, flexible, customizable and **scalable**, in order to adapt to future expansion or changes in the Group structure.

## Enterprise Performance Management

### Slide 1

Enterprise Performance Management refers to the management approach which **integrates** multiple business processes to allow organizations to gain visibility into their **performance**. 
It allows them to plan, measure, analyze and optimize performance, resulting in improved **decision-making** and higher profitability.

Here, we can see the Enterprise Performance Management Framework, which is composed of three phases: Strategy, Execution and Performance.

The **strategy** phase is the foundation of the EPM cycle as it refers to the definition of the strategic goals to achieve.
Then, the **execution** phase focuses on implementing the strategies set during the previous phase, ensuring that day-to-day activities are in line with the overall goals of the organization.
Finally, the **performance** phase involves evaluating the organization's performance deriving insights in order to drive continuous improvement.

### Slide 2

As organizations strive for excellence, EPM offers them a **systematic approach** to measure and improve performance across various dimensions.
We can identify different **benefits** and **challenges** associated with its implementation.

First, it facilitates improved **performance measurement** and **reporting** capabilities.
At the same time, it enhances **transparency** and accountability, fostering trust and communication within the organization.

Another benefit regards its ability to support **strategic alignment** as, by integrating performance management with strategic objectives, organizations can ensure that day-to-day activities align with long-term goals.

On the other hand, implementing and EPM solution cn an pose **challenges** for organizations, like, resistance to change, resource constraints or the need for a robust **technology infrastructure**.

## Oracle Cloud EPM Implementation

### Slide 1

The Holding Group has a complex **financial structure** and was facing significant challenges in managing financial data across the Entities.
Also, its reporting processes were inefficient, relying heavily on manual data entry and lacking **visibility** across the Brands.

The first step in the creation of an EPM solution is the selection of the most **suitable tool** among the ones available.

Here, we can see the **Gartner Magic Quadrant** for financial planning software published in 2022.
As we can see, **Oracle Cloud** has been named Leader as it is recognized for its ability to provide a **comprehensive** and **customizable** EPM solution.

Oracle Cloud EPM brings together multiple capabilities into a **single suite**, ranging from financial planning to cost management and tax reporting.

For the Holding Group, Oracle Cloud EPM was the right choice due to its ability to be **customized** to meet the specific needs of the organization.

### Slide 2

To better explain the implementation process, let's start by getting a comprehensive understanding of the **elements involved** in the process.

The suite of Oracle CLoud EPM includes various **modules** that are designed to address specific business needs.
For this project, we will focus on **Planning and Budgeting**, which offers a cloud environment that allows organizations to streamline their processes in a collaborative environment with flexible modeling and real-time visibility.

One fundamental component of Oracle Cloud EPM refers to **Dimensions**.
Considering that we are working with Multidimensional Databases, dimensions provide a way to organize data, allowing users to perform complex calculations among them.

Dimensions are typically structured as **hierarchies**, with each level representing a different **level of detail**, and we usually have a dimension for each domain of the process.
Here, we can see some of the dimensions of the database, which are the Geography dimension, Channel of Distribution, Product, Brand and Entity.

### Slide 3

To load financial data into the system, we need to undertake a process of **data normalization** and **mapping**, in order to align data coming from different sources to the dimensions and members in the target system.

Of course, the different Entities have different **data collection** tools and methodologies, ranging from, for example, ERP software solutions like SAP, Excel spreadsheets or Cloud solutions.

The process of data load run **continuously** in order to keep the EPM system up-to-date with respect to the financial situation of the Holding Group.
Therefore, it is important to **update** the loading process **systematically** to allow the system to run smoothly and meet changes in business operations.

## Costs and Revenues Management

Enterprise Performance Management encompasses various processes and methodologies aimed at managing and improving the **financial performance** of an organization. 
**Revenue** and **cost** management play crucial roles in EPM, ensuring effective financial planning and analysis.

In this regard, while working on various sections of the EPM solution, two **implementations** emerged as particularly relevant, showcasing how **Oracle Cloud EPM** can meet specific needs of customers: Cost Allocation and Intercompany Management.
