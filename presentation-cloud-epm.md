*Usual pleasantries, like ...*

*Good morning, my name is Francesca, and I am thrilled to present my thesis defense on the role of Oracle Cloud EPM Business Rules for Efficient Planning. 
I am deeply grateful to Prof. Matteo Francia for his guidance and support throughout this journey. 
Without further delay, let's move to the content of the project.*

## Overview

This thesis is linked to my curricular internship carried out at PwC, during which I had the opportunity to work on this project for a Holding Group which is a global leader in the fashion and design industry.

- **Introduction**: We will start with a brief overview of the project, exploring its scope, objectives and requirements.
- **EPM**: We will deepen he concept of EPM, analyzing its benefits and challenges.
- **Oracle Cloud EPM**: We will explore the Oracle Cloud EPM implementation journey with all its phases.
- **Costs and Revenues in EPM**: We will then move to the core part of the project - my role in the implementation - which regards the management of revenues and costs in the EPM environment. We will see two key processes, which are:
- **Cost allocation**
- **Intercompany management**
- **Conclusions**: Finally, we will get some insights and final thoughts about the project.

## Introduction

### Slide 1

In today's highly competitive business environment and, with the advent of **digital transformation**, companies are now offered with huge opportunities and challenges.

One of the prerequisites to stay competitive in the digital era is to be able to effectively manage **corporate performance** using performance management systems.

The goal of the project is to improve the overall financial performance of the Holding Group by improving data accuracy and gaining real-time **visibility** into financial data across all the Entities which compose the Group.

Prior to this implementation, the Holding Group faced significant **challenges** in accessing and **consolidating** financial data from across the Entities.

So, with the **EPM system**, they plan to achieve an **integrated view** of the data belonging to the different Entities, which can be used for planning, reporting, budgeting and forecasting purposes.

### Slide 2

The requirements for the project fall within the goal of designing and maintaining a **comprehensive** and **integrated** planning solution to gain visibility and control over the Group's performance.
