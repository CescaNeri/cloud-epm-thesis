\section{Background and significance of the study}

Enterprise Performance Management is a management approach that involves using data and analytics to monitor, measure, and improve an organization's performance. 
%
It integrates various management processes, including financial planning, budgeting, forecasting, risk management, and performance measurement, to help organizations align their goals with their strategies and improve their overall performance.
%
To access and analyze data more quickly and accurately, organizations typically use software applications that automate and streamline this process.

These application often include dashboards, pre-built report templates and other tools that provide real-time insights into organizational performance.

The ultimate goal of EPM is to help organizations to achieve their strategic objectives and optimize their performance, whether that be in terms of financial performance, customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, or other key performance indicators. 
%
By using data-driven insights and decision-making, EPM enables organizations to more effectively manage risks, allocate resources, and make strategic decisions that improve their overall performance and competitiveness in the marketplace.

Enterprise Performance Management operates within a complex and dynamic business environment, characterized by a number of key trends and challenges. 
%
One of the most significant trends in recent years has been the growing adoption of cloud technology for enterprise applications, including EPM. 

Cloud-based EPM solutions offer many advantages over traditional on-premises systems, including greater scalability, flexibility, and accessibility, as well as lower costs and reduced IT complexity. 
%
As a result, more and more organizations are turning to cloud-based EPM solutions to improve their performance management processes.

Another key trend in modern business is the growing importance of data-driven decision making. 
%
With the increasing availability of data and advanced analytical tools, organizations are able to gain deeper insights into their operations and performance, and make more informed decisions. 
%
EPM plays a critical role in this trend by providing real-time insights into organizational performance and enabling managers to make data-driven decisions that align with their strategic goals. 
%
This helps organizations to be more proactive in identifying and responding to performance issues, and to optimize their operations and resources to achieve their desired outcomes.

In addition to these trends, EPM also operates within a business environment that is constantly evolving and adapting to changing market conditions. 
%
The need for businesses to be agile and responsive to these changes is an ongoing challenge, and EPM can help address this by providing a flexible and adaptable framework for performance management. 
%
By monitoring key performance indicators and providing real-time insights into performance, EPM enables businesses to quickly identify and respond to changes in market conditions, and to make strategic decisions that keep them ahead of the competition.

Overall, the context in which EPM operates is characterized by a rapidly evolving business environment, where technology, data, and agility are critical to success. 
%
Enterprise Performance Management plays a critical role in helping organizations to adapt to these trends and challenges, by providing a data-driven and agile approach to performance management that enables them to optimize their operations, resources, and strategic decision making.

\section{Scope and limitations of the study}

The scope of the project includes different areas of focus that range from the definition of Enterprise Performance Management, its benefits, its implementation in companies and the future trends.
%
The thesis starts by defining what Enterprise Performance Management is and how it differs from the other management approaches in place.

Then, the project investigates the potential benefits that EPM can bring to modern businesses including enhanced decision-making, better alignment of business objectives with strategies, increased efficiency and improved performance.
%
It then explores the challenges associated with implementing EPM solutions in businesses which, for example, include issues related to data collection and analysis, performance measurement, reporting and the use of technologies and specific software.
%
Data is the core element of a performance management system; in order to have accurate reports and effective forecasts, it is important to have large quantities of data which which the EPM system is populated. 

The project aims at analyzing a case study regarding the implementation of an EPM solution in a company.
%
Then, it explores the future trends and challenges that are likely to impact the role of Enterprise Performance Management in relation with emerging technologies, changing business models, and evolving business needs and expectations.

There are some limitations related to the study that should be taken into account.
%
Such limitations include both extrinsic and intrinsic elements of the project, ranging from the access to large amounts of data, the complexity of the topic investigated and the diversity of applications involved.

More in details, in order to explore the impact of Enterprise Performance Management on businesses, it may be necessary to have access to data related to business performance belonging to different organizations.
%
In this thesis, we will analyze a case of implementation carried out for a specific company, with their own characteristics in terms of operations and business management, which operates in a specific industry sector. 
%
Modern businesses vary widely in terms of size, sector, business model and many other factors.
%
In particular, the activities of management and performance control carried out by the company have a significant impact on how the EPM solution will be implemented and maintained.
%
Of course, there is no single solution that can be applied to any business but they vary according to the needs of the company.
%
As a result, it can be difficult to generalize findings in one type of business to other types of businesses.

\section{Overview of the methodology}

The methodology applied to the implementation of an Enterprise Project Management solution follows some key steps and best practices that depend on the specific requirements of the client company, the size and complexity of the project and the available resources.
%
The entire implementation process is built together with the client company which is responsible for assessing the quality of each step and ensuring the compliance with the requested features of the system.

The project begins with a planning phase, during which the company's business needs and goals are identified and the scope of the project is defined.
%
This involves identifying the objectives and key deliverables of the project, as well as any constraints or assumptions that will impact the implementation.
%
During this phases, it is important to identify the stakeholders by determining who will be impacted by the implementation and what their needs and requirements are.
%
Another key element in the planning phase is the definition of success criteria in order to measure the outcome by using performance indicators.
%
Finally, a clear and detailed project plan is developed, outlining the timeline, the budget, and resources required to complete the implementation.

Then, during the solution design phase, the EPM solution is designed based on the identified business requirements and goals, including the configuration of the environment, customizing features and workflows, and integrating with other systems.

The development and testing phase is the core part of the project.
%
In this phase the EPM solution is built and configured, relying on a process of continuous feedback from the customer.
%
Both individual components and the solution as a whole are tested to ensure that they meet the business requirements and goals.

After that, the client company's personnel which will use the system is trained through training sessions, user manuals, and other resources to help users understand the system and use it effectively.

Finally, the solution is deployed to the client's company environment.
%
If applicable, the data of the old system will be migrated into the new one, which will be integrating with additional existing systems.
%
After the EPM solution is deployed, configured and permissions are set, ongoing support and maintenance are provided to ensure the system runs smoothly and meets the company's needs.
%
This involves providing technical support, troubleshooting issues, and applying updates to keep up with the software advancements.
